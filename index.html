      <p>I am a creative person with a great interest in the field of information technology. Although I have no experience in the IT industry, I was previously engaged in drawing and went to art school. This allowed me to develop creative thinking, visual perception and attention to detail. I am attracted to creative directions in IT, as they provide an opportunity to combine my love of art with the opportunities offered by modern technology.</p>
      <p>I am open to learning and eager to learn new things. I am ready to invest time and effort in studying various tools and technologies related to the creative aspects of IT. I am also a real communicator and easily find a common language with other people. I am ready to work in a team, exchange ideas and learn from colleagues.</p>
      <p>My goal in the IT industry is to develop in the field of creative directions and apply my skills in creating unique and attractive visual solutions. I am ready to contribute to the development of innovative projects and collaborate with talented professionals to create excellent products and improve the user experience.</p>
